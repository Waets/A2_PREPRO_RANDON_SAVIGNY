	<h2 class="textesurimage">A commanding presence, Phantom Family encapsulates contemporary luxury. Its signature design is complemented by modern features, with the potential to personalise it to the smallest detail. Born of the desire to build The Best Car in the World, Phantom is the result of complete creative and engineering freedom.

When it came to designing the current Phantom Family, it’s fitting that the influence came from Sir Henry Royce himself: “Strive for perfection in everything you do. Take the best that exists and make it better. When it doesn’t exist, design it.” From that challenge, Phantom was born. And the result is the definition of automotive design and technological perfection.

Phantom is a timeless interpretation of the modern luxury motor car. With its powerful stance, iconic proportions and state-of-the-art technology, it’s the signature Rolls-Royce. The engine delivers an abundance of effortless power – a magic carpet-like ride – that creates a driving experience like no other. But the pleasure begins even before you own a Phantom, as you can choose the personal features to make your motor car truly unique. This is a motor car to be commissioned, to represent your personal expression.
