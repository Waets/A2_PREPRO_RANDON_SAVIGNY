                    <p>
                        A commanding presence, Phantom Family encapsulates contemporary luxury. Its signature
                        design is
                        complemented by modern features, with the potential to personalise it to the smallest detail.
                        Born
                        of the
                        desire to build The Best Car in the World, Phantom is the result of complete creative and
                        engineering
                        freedom.

                        When it came to designing the current Phantom Family, it’s fitting that the influence came from
                        Sir
                        Henry
                        Royce himself: “Strive for perfection in everything you do. Take the best that exists and make
                        it
                        better.
                        When it doesn’t exist, design it.” From that challenge, Phantom was born. And the result is the
                        definition
                        of automotive design and technological perfection.

                        Phantom is a timeless interpretation of the modern luxury motor car. With its powerful stance,
                        iconic
                        proportions and state-of-the-art technology, it’s the signature Rolls-Royce. The engine delivers
                        an
                        abundance of effortless power – a magic carpet-like ride – that creates a driving experience
                        like no
                        other.
                        But the pleasure begins even before you own a Phantom, as you can choose the personal features
                        to
                        make your
                        motor car truly unique. This is a motor car to be commissioned, to represent your personal
                        expression.
